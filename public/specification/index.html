<main><h1>Specification of JSONNORM 1.0.0</h1><h1 id="jsonnorm-100"><code>JSONNORM 1.0.0</code></h1>
<p>This is the specification for a normalized expresion of the JSON data
format. This format is strictly a superset of the JSON specification defined
at <a href="https://json.org/">https://json.org/</a>. That is to say, this specification is IN ADDITION TO
the default specification. Nothing is changed or removed from the default.</p>
<p>So, NOT all JSON documents can be stored in JSONNORM format, but &hellip;</p>
<p>.. all JSONNORM documents are stored in fully compliant JSON format.</p>
<p>This specification uses the phrase &ldquo;document&rdquo; to refer to a JSON
serialization <em>in it&rsquo;s entirety.</em></p>
<h2 id="document-must-be-based-on-an-object">DOCUMENT MUST BE BASED ON AN OBJECT</h2>
<p>The default specification allows for any elements or values in a documents. However,
JSONNORM limits the base element to a single object. This is very often
what is seen in typical practice, but JSONNORM specifies this explicitly.</p>

  </div><span style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><em>A document must always be based on an object.</em></span></div>

<h2 id="lines-and-line-endings">LINES AND LINE ENDINGS</h2>
<p>A line contains one or more UTF8 characters terminated by a LINE FEED (U+000A).</p>
<p>This is true of all lines, including the final <code>}</code> at the end of the document.</p>
<p>Except within strings (including names), the characters are further
restricted to the ASCII character set.</p>
<p>CARRIAGE RETURN and other control characters are not allowed anywhere in the
document. Their equivalents in strings are backslash-quoted. See the JSON spec
for further details.</p>
<p>There is no line length limit.</p>
<h2 id="indentation">INDENTATION</h2>
<p>Indentation is two SPACE (U+0020) characters. All indentation rises and falls
by increments and decrements of two SPACE characters.</p>
<p>At the start of a document, indentation begins at zero.</p>
<p>Every object or array causes it&rsquo;s subtending elements to be further indented
by 2 additional SPACEs.</p>
<p>Tabs and other UTF8 WHITESPACE characters are not allowed in the documents
except in strings.</p>
<h2 id="strings">STRINGS</h2>
<p>Strings are encapsulated by QUOTATION MARKS (U+0022). They contain zero or
more UTF8 characters between them.</p>
<p>If a slash, quotation mark, or control character is contained within a string,
it is escaped with a backslash per the JSON spec. Some will need to use the
<code>\uHHHH</code> hex escapement.</p>
<p>All other characters are NOT to be escaped. For example a <code>\u00E3</code> will be
normalized to a direct <code>Ã£</code> character.</p>
<p>There is no character limit to a string.</p>
<h2 id="regarding-rtl-languages">REGARDING RTL LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the ordering of the UTF8 characters in a string is to be determined
by the applications using the JSON documents. As such, that detail is outside
the specification.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the most common method of character order
storage in strings is by first-to-last usage order, NOT the LTR vs RTL display
order.</p>
<p>In fact, the JSON specification does not presume left to right. It is ordered
by first to last. If a boolean value is <code>true</code> for example, it will probably
display <code>true</code> when <em>viewed</em> LTR, and will displayed <code>eurt</code> when <em>viewed</em> RTL.
What is important is that the <code>t</code> is at index +0 and the <code>e</code> is at index +3. How
it is displayed is a matter of presentation.</p>
<h2 id="objects">OBJECTS</h2>
<p>A JSON document, when normalized, must be based on an object.</p>
<p>Every object starts with a LEFT CURLY BRACKET (U+007B) <code>{</code>, which ends the line.</p>
<p>Every object ends on a line starting with an RIGHT CURLY BRACKET (U+007D) <code>}</code>. If
needed, then a comma immediately follows. Otherwise, the line ends also.</p>
<p>The open and closing brackets are at the SAME level of indentation. And empty
object has no line between that starting line and the ending line. An empty
object may NOT be represented by a curly bracket pair  <code>{}</code> on a single line.</p>
<p>An object has zero or more elements, each of which has a name, a colon, and a
value. (See JSON spec.) The order of these is SORTED by name (see NAME
SORTING next).</p>
<p>Names may not be duplicated in the context of a single object. The JSON spec
allows repeating of the same name, but JSONNORM does NOT.</p>
<p>The name is a string. It is immediately followed by a colon. That is then
followed by a single SPACE. That is then followed by the value (or start of
the value if an object or array).</p>
<p>Each name/value element is separated by a comma. The comma is placed
immediately after the value and is followed by the LINE FEED that ends the line.</p>
<p>The JSON spec does not allow for &ldquo;trailing commas&rdquo; in a list of name/values, so
inserting an name/value element to the end of an object will appear as a &ldquo;change to the
last line&rdquo; (to add the comma) plus the insertion of the new line.</p>
<h2 id="name-sorting">NAME SORTING</h2>
<p>The fields in an object are to be sorted by their name so that the same data
is always represented in the same order.</p>
<p>It is tempting sort using the official Unicode collation algorithm.
That algorithm would sort the fields in strict alphabetic order that is very
familiar to human readers. For example, the collation algorithm would sort the
following characters in this order:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>A a Ã  B
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, the collation algorithm has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>(major) The algorithm changes. In fact, UTF8 itself changes as new characters
are added/removed by the Unicode Consortium. The collation algorithmm itself
changes. It is currently on version 14.</li>
<li>(minor) The algorithm is very complex and not available in all computer
languages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Predictability is more important for normalization than human comfort. So,
instead the name strings are to be simply sorted by UTF8 character.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means the example list would be sorted</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>A B a Ã 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which is less intuitive.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not the same thing as sorting by byte (like one can
do with ASCII strings.) Instead, each UTF8 character, which can be 8, 16 or
32 bits in size, should be placed into unsigned 32-bit integer arrays. And
those arrays are used as the source of determining whether one name comes
before another.</p>
<p>Duplicate names are forbidden in the context of an object&rsquo;s name/value
list.</p>
<h2 id="arrays">ARRAYS</h2>
<p>A JSON array is an ordered sequence of unnamed values.</p>
<p>A JSON array is NOT an array in the strict sense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)">used in Computer
Science</a>.
Computer Science defines an array as an ordered sequence of entries of the same
type/size. But a JSON array allows mixed types. So it is <em>technically</em> a
<strong>list</strong>. The unfortunate naming is due to the historical connection of JSON
to Javascript which  is historically connected to C, which used
arrays-of-pointers to store mixed data-type lists. However, to prevent
confusion, we will still refer to these lists as arrays.</p>
<p>The original spec leaves this nature undiscussed, so this specification
states it explicitly: arrays may mix data types.</p>
<div class="code sidebar-footer" id=""><div class="code-content" >
      <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;a-list&#34;</span>: [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">null</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;bob&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ],
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
  </div><span style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><em>The value of &#34;a-list&#34; is a perfectly valid array. The 4th item in that array is also a perfectly valid array.</em></span></div>

<p>The start of an array begins with a LEFT SQUARE BRACKET (U+005B) <code>[</code> and ends
the current line.</p>
<p>The entries of the array are indented by a further 2 spaces. Each entry
starts it&rsquo;s own line.</p>
<p>The end of an array is on a new line with a RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET (U+005D) <code>]</code>. It
is followed by a comma if needed. Then the line is terminated with a LINE FEED.</p>
<p>The open and closing brackets are always on separate lines even if the array
is empty.</p>
<p>The JSON spec does not allow for &ldquo;trailing commas&rdquo; in an array, so
inserting a value to the end of an list will appear as a &ldquo;change to the
last line&rdquo; (to add the comma) plus the insertion of the new line.</p>
<h2 id="empty-vs-unknown-vs-void">EMPTY VS UNKNOWN VS VOID</h2>
<p>Philosophically, there are subtle but real distinctions between these three
concepts and the original JSON spec <em>implies</em> them, but does not address the
issue explicity.</p>
<p>All three ideas represent &ldquo;missing&rdquo; or not-existent values. They are
represented in three different ways in JSON. JSONNORM is very explicit about
this to avoid confusion.</p>
<h4 id="empty">EMPTY</h4>
<p>An empty value is a real value, but that value is &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; or
&ldquo;emptiness&rdquo; or &ldquo;the scale of nothing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a document, they are represented as:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value type</th>
<th>empty</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>string</td>
<td><code>&quot;&quot;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>number</td>
<td><code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>object</td>
<td><code>{</code><br><code>}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>array</td>
<td><code>[</code><br><code>]</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The boolean value type (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) has no &ldquo;empty&rdquo; representation. It
is common in most computer languages to use <code>false</code> as a stand-in for empty.
So, this specification will also use <code>false</code> has the less-than-ideal meaning of
boolean emptiness.</p>
<p>An example of emptiness in mathematics:</p>
<p><strong>3 + 0 = 3</strong> â´ <em>Adding nothing to 3 results in 3.</em></p>
<h4 id="unknown">UNKNOWN</h4>
<p>In computer science, a value that is not yet known (or might not ever be
known), is called a <code>NULL</code> or <code>NUL</code>. There is a theoretical value, but it is
simply not known in the context.</p>
<p>In JSON, a &ldquo;value type&rdquo; of <code>null</code> is given to represent this concept.</p>
<p>This is why a list such as <code>[3, 2, null, -5]</code> has four values, not three. One of them is
simply not known.</p>
<p><a href="https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-null-in-sql/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20an%20SQL%20NULL,until%20the%20order%20has%20arrived.">reference from SQL for
NULL</a></p>
<p>Note: verbally, is it more accurate to say &ldquo;this value is null&rdquo; than &ldquo;this
value equals null.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Note: <code>NULL</code> is <em>not</em> the same thing as a <code>NIL</code>. <code>NIL</code> is an empty pointer or
reference often used in computer programming. So, <code>NIL</code> is the EMPTY state for a
value type of &ldquo;pointer&rdquo;. JSON does not explicitly store pointer values, so <code>NIL</code>
is never used in JSON.</p>
<p>Note: <code>&quot;null&quot;</code> and <code>null</code> are different things in JSON. The first is a four
letter string containing the word &ldquo;null&rdquo;, the second is an actual null.</p>
<p>An example of NULL in mathematics:</p>
<p><strong>3 + x = y</strong> â´ <em>Adding unknown x to 3 results in unknown y.</em></p>
<p>So, if later, the first NULL (x) is found to be 5, then the second NULL (y) will
become 8. Essentially, a NULL is an variable whose value is not known.</p>
<h4 id="void">VOID</h4>
<p>There are multiple names for this concept. In the programming language C it is
called <code>void</code>. In paperwork, it is often called &ldquo;non-applicable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is explicitly stating that there cannot be a value; not simply that it
is not known.</p>
<p>In JSON, a VOID is represented by ommision. In other words, you can
represent VOID by <em>not</em> including a value in the document. Because JSON structure is
dynamic, this works quite well.</p>
<p>An example using real world objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>a spider has 8 legs,</li>
<li>a worm has zero legs (EMPTY),</li>
<li>an unknown creature trapped in a box has an unknown number of legs (NULL), but</li>
<li>an asteroid can&rsquo;t have legs; it is a silly question (VOID).</li>
</ul>
<p>An example in mathematics:</p>
<p><strong>3 + â x = 3</strong> â´ <em>There does not exist x, so it is not added to 3, which results in 3.</em></p>
<h3 id="example-of-all-three-in-one-document">Example of All Three in One document</h3>
<p>With the following document for values A, B, C, and D:</p>
<div class="code sidebar-footer" id=""><div class="code-content" >
      <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
  </div></div>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;A&rdquo; has a list that is not empty.</li>
<li>&ldquo;B&rdquo; has a list that is EMPTY.</li>
<li>&ldquo;C&rdquo; has an UNKNOWN value.</li>
<li>&ldquo;D&rdquo; is VOID as it is ommitted from the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, some public programming libraries and frameworks cannot easily distinquish
between these three conditions and tend to convolute them.</p>
<p>In fact, arbitrarily treating missing parameters (VOID) as NULL values is a
known attack vector against some web frameworks. But discussing this is outside
the scope of this specification.</p>
<h2 id="numbers">NUMBERS</h2>
<p>Normalizing numbers in JSON spec has at least 5 challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>[infinity]</code> Numbers can be infinite in size. Is this realistic?</li>
<li><code>[diff exp]</code> With exponent support there are multiple ways to express the exact same
number. (<code>1.23E4</code> vs <code>12.3E3</code>)</li>
<li><code>[marker]</code> The exponent marker can either be lower case <code>e</code> or upper case <code>E</code>.</li>
<li><code>[sig]</code> There is no discussion of significance (or the related concept of
precision).
(e.g. <code>1.00</code> vs <code>1.000</code>) Is significance stored or ignored?</li>
<li><code>[bin]</code> Numbers are expressed in decimal but a common source-of-truth for JSON,
Javascript, stores them as binary floats; not decimal floats. Binary is
base 2 and Decimal is base 10 (2 * 5). This causes conversion errors in some
circumstances. (This is not a bug but a philosophical difference between
numbering systems.) Most libraries follow this convention of storing in binary.</li>
</ol>
<p>This section of the specification resolves these issues, but acknowledges that
the chosen answer is not perfect for all users.</p>
<p>Numbers are to be stored in a manner that complies with IEEE 754-2008 decimal
128-bit standard using DPD encoding as it commonly expressed in libraries.
This does NOT mean that an app or library that reads or
writes JSONNORM compliant documents must store the numbers in decimal. It
simply means that the expression of the number must match that format.</p>
<p>So, the chosen answer to the above restrictions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>[infinity]</code> Numbers are limited to 11 digits of precision. That is, the main
number cannot have more than 11 decimal digits. If converting to JSONNORM
the remaining digits are rounded per the well known
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?BankersRounding">BANKERS ROUNDING</a> algorithm.
The exponent is limited to the range â6143 to +6144. If a greater/lesser
exponent is needed, the document is not expressable in JSONNORM.
Examples: <code>1.23456789012345</code> becomes <code>1.2345678901</code>. <code>9876543210987654</code> becomes
<code>9.8765432110E15</code> (notice the rounding).</li>
<li><code>[diff exp]</code> Numbers needing an exponent are expressed in scientific notation,
which has a single leading digit before the decimal point. Other numbers do
not use the exponent. So, <code>10.0E4</code> becomes <code>1.00E5</code>.
And, <code>1.00E2</code> becomes <code>100</code>.</li>
<li><code>[marker]</code> Use upper case <code>E</code>. If the exponent is negative, prefix with a <code>-</code>,
but if the exponent is positive do NOT prefix with a plus sign.
Examples: <code>3.243E20</code> and <code>9.999900E-338</code></li>
<li><code>[sig]</code> Significance and precision are expressable. So, <code>1.0</code> and <code>1.000</code> are
different numbers.
This specification does not require that the app using those numbers actually
honors precision or not. It is, however, expressed and honored as if it did.</li>
<li><code>[bin]</code> Numbers are expressed per the IEEE 754-2008 128-bit DPD-encoding
characteristics. Individual apps might or might not actually honor those
characteristics, but documents will be expressed as if they were.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leading zeroes are not permmitted. This is already part of the JSON spec.</p>
<p>Note: The IEEE 754-2008 encoding allows for infinity (<code>+inf</code> <code>-inf</code>) and not-a-number
(<code>NaN</code>). However, neither JSON or JSONNORM documents allow for such expressions.</p>
